# Training
python train.py -opt options/train/Flower_S1.yml

--> the model weights are stored in "flower_S1" folder


python train.py -opt options/train/Flower_S2.yml

--> the model weights are stored in "flower_S2" folder

# Testing
## Using pretrained model

Download the pre-trained models (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X3oos6dmtDDo9IqC6SK5RiujMYE6Y22q?usp=drive_link) and place them in experiments/pretrained_models/

modify the weight path in options/test/Flower.yml

python test.py -opt options/test/Flower.yml


## Using trained model
python test.py -opt options/test/Flower.yml
